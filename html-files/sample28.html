    <h1>Angular: A Powerful JavaScript Framework</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Angular is a popular open-source JavaScript framework for building web
        applications. It provides developers with a robust set of tools and
        features to create dynamic, single-page applications (SPAs) efficiently.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Key Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Component-based architecture: Angular follows a component-based
          approach, making it easier to build reusable and maintainable code.
        </li>
        <li>
          Two-way data binding: Angular's data binding capabilities allow for
          seamless synchronization between the application's data model and the
          user interface, simplifying development.
        </li>
        <li>
          Dependency injection: Angular offers a powerful dependency injection
          system, facilitating the management and sharing of components and
          services.
        </li>
        <li>
          Routing: Angular's built-in router enables the creation of multi-page
          applications with URL-based navigation and lazy-loading of modules.
        </li>
        <li>
          Testing: Angular provides comprehensive testing support through tools
          like Jasmine and Karma, making it easier to write and execute unit
          tests.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Development Workflow</h2>
      <p>When working with Angular, developers typically follow these steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Set up the development environment by installing Node.js, Angular CLI,
          and any other required dependencies.
        </li>
        <li>Create a new Angular project using the Angular CLI.</li>
        <li>
          Design and develop the application's components, services, and other
          building blocks.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use Angular's CLI commands to build, test, and run the application
          during development.
        </li>
        <li>
          Deploy the application to a web server or a cloud platform for
          production.
        </li>
      </ol>
