    <h1>About DNA</h1>
    <p>
      DNA, or Deoxyribonucleic Acid, is a molecule that carries genetic
      instructions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Found in the cells of all living organisms</li>
      <li>Consists of a double helix structure made up of nucleotides</li>
      <li>
        Contains the genetic information that determines an organism's traits
        and characteristics
      </li>
      <li>
        Plays a crucial role in inheritance and the passing of traits from one
        generation to the next
      </li>
      <li>
        Used in various scientific fields, including genetics, forensics, and
        biotechnology
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      DNA is often referred to as the "building blocks of life" and is
      fundamental to understanding the complexity of living organisms.
