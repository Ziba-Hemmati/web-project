    <h1>Artificial Intelligence</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that focuses
      on creating intelligent machines capable of performing tasks that
      typically require human intelligence. AI systems aim to simulate human
      cognitive processes, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving,
      perception, and language understanding.
