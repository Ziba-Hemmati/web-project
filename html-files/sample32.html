    <h1>Rick and Morty API</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The Rick and Morty API is a free and public API that provides access to
      data related to the popular animated TV show "Rick and Morty." It allows
      developers to retrieve information about episodes, characters, locations,
      and more.
    </p>
    <h2>API Endpoints</h2>
    <p>
      The Rick and Morty API offers several endpoints to access different types
      of data:
    </p>

        specific episode based on its ID.

        in the series.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Usage and Integration</h2>
    <p>
      The Rick and Morty API can be used by developers to incorporate Rick and
      Morty data into their own applications, websites, or projects. Here are a
      few examples:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Displaying Episode Information: Developers can retrieve episode details
        and display them, including the episode title, air date, and characters
        featured in each episode.
      </li>
      <li>
        Character Search: Users can search for characters by name and retrieve
        detailed information about them, such as their species, status, and
        origin.
      </li>
      <li>
        Location Mapping: The API allows developers to access location data from
        the show, enabling the creation of interactive maps or visualizations of
        various places in the Rick and Morty universe.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Authentication and Rate Limits</h2>
    <p>
      The Rick and Morty API does not require authentication to access its
      endpoints, making it easy for developers to start using the data right
      away. However, it does impose rate limits to ensure fair usage and prevent
      abuse.
    </p>
