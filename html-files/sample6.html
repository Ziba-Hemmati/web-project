    <h1>Mountains</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Mountains are majestic landforms that rise above the surrounding areas,
      typically characterized by steep slopes, high elevations, and rugged
      terrains. They are found on every continent and play a significant role in
      shaping the Earth's landscape.
    </p>
    <h2>Types of Mountains</h2>
    <h3>Volcanic Mountains</h3>
    <p>
      Volcanic mountains are formed by the accumulation of volcanic materials,
      such as lava, ash, and pyroclastic debris. They are typically cone-shaped
      and can be found near volcanic hotspots or along tectonic plate
      boundaries. Mount Fuji in Japan and Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania are
      examples of volcanic mountains.
    </p>
    <h2>Highest Mountains</h2>
    <p>
      The highest mountains in the world are part of the Himalayan range. Mount
      Everest, standing at 8,848 meters (29,029 feet), is the tallest mountain
      on Earth. Other notable peaks in the Himalayas include K2, Kangchenjunga,
      and Makalu.
