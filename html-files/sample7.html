    <h1>Renewable Energy</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Renewable energy refers to energy sources that are naturally replenished
      and have a minimal impact on the environment. Unlike fossil fuels, which
      are finite and contribute to climate change, renewable energy technologies
      harness natural resources such as sunlight, wind, water, and geothermal
      heat to generate clean and sustainable power.
