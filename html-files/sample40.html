    <h1>PWD Command</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The `pwd` command, short for "print working directory," is a command-line
      utility used in various operating systems, including Unix, Linux, and
      macOS. It displays the current working directory, which represents the
      directory or folder in the file system where the user is currently
      located.
    </p>
    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>
      The `pwd` command is straightforward to use. When executed, it outputs the
      absolute path of the current directory to the command-line interface. This
      information can be helpful when navigating through the file system or when
      needing to know the exact location of a specific file or directory.
    </p>
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>
      Let's consider a scenario where a user is working in the command-line
      interface:
    </p>
    <pre>
    $ cd Documents
    $ cd Projects
    $ pwd
    /home/user/Documents/Projects
    </pre>
    <p>
      In this example, the user navigates to the "Documents" directory and then
      to the "Projects" directory within it. When the `pwd` command is executed,
      it returns the absolute path "/home/user/Documents/Projects" to indicate
      the current working directory.
    </p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      The `pwd` command is a useful tool for displaying the current working
      directory in a command-line interface. By providing the absolute path of
      the current directory, it helps users understand their location within the
      file system and facilitates efficient navigation and file management.
