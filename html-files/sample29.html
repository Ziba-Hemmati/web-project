    <h1>Java Virtual Machine (JVM): An Overview</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a fundamental component of the Java
        platform. It provides a runtime environment that enables the execution
        of Java bytecode, allowing Java programs to run on any platform that has
        a compatible JVM.
      </p>
    </section>

      <h2>Key Components</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Class Loader: The JVM's class loader loads Java class files into
          memory, resolves dependencies, and performs necessary runtime tasks.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bytecode Verifier: The bytecode verifier checks the validity and
          integrity of the bytecode instructions to ensure they do not violate
          security constraints.
        </li>
        <li>
          Runtime Data Areas: The JVM's runtime data areas include the method
          area, heap, stack, and program counter, which are used for managing
          memory and executing Java programs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Execution Engine: The execution engine interprets and executes the
          bytecode instructions or uses just-in-time (JIT) compilation to
          convert them into machine code for improved performance.
        </li>
        <li>
          Garbage Collector: The JVM's garbage collector automatically manages
          memory by reclaiming unused objects and freeing up memory for
          efficient resource utilization.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Functionality and Benefits</h2>
      <p>The JVM provides several important features and benefits:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Platform Independence: Java programs compiled to bytecode can run on
          any platform with a compatible JVM, enabling "write once, run
          anywhere" portability.
        </li>
        <li>
          Memory Management: The JVM's garbage collector automates memory
          management, relieving developers from manual memory allocation and
          deallocation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Security: The JVM enforces security features, such as bytecode
          verification, to prevent malicious or unauthorized code execution.
        </li>
        <li>
          Performance Optimization: The JVM's execution engine employs various
          techniques, including JIT compilation, to optimize the performance of
          Java applications.
        </li>
        <li>
          Dynamic Runtime: The JVM supports dynamic class loading and dynamic
          linking, allowing applications to load and use classes at runtime.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Alternative JVM Languages</h2>
      <p>
        While the JVM is primarily associated with Java, it also supports
        several alternative languages that compile to bytecode and can be
        executed on the JVM. Some popular examples include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Kotlin: A modern programming language that offers interoperability
          with Java and provides additional features and syntax enhancements.
        </li>
        <li>
          Scala: A powerful language that combines object-oriented and
          functional programming paradigms and provides advanced features for
          building scalable applications.
        </li>
        <li>
          Groovy: A dynamic language that integrates seamlessly with Java and
          offers concise syntax and enhanced productivity.
        </li>
        <li>
          Clojure: A dialect of Lisp that runs on the JVM and emphasizes
          immutability and functional programming.
        </li>
      </ul>
